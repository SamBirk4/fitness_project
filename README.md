Fitness Track:

Fitness Track is an application that tracks a users weight, gain or loss, BMI (Body Mass Index), and the date and time of the entry.  The user is initially ased to enter their height and weight in order to get the baseline for calculating the gain or loss and the BMI.  Once this is entered the user can enter a new weigh-in to the program and it will return the new weight, if there as a gain or loss and by how much,  the BMI using the new weight entered, and the date and time that to entry was made.  This is all writen to a CSV file and then read back to the user to show all of their previous entries. All data is saved into a MongoDB database and all updates are uploaded to the github repository.
